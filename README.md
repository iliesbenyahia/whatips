**whatips** is a small Go application that retrieves your current public IP address and compares it to a DNS record.  
Currently, it only supports [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/) as the DNS provider because that is where my personal domain name is registered.  

That said, it is not impossible that the project could be extended in the future to support other DNS registrars and become more generic.

## üåê Features

- Fetches your public IP address using `https://api.ipify.org`
- Compares it against a DNS record from Gandi (only supported provider for now)
- Designed for automation (e.g., cron jobs, CI, etc.)
